- Use IRC if crystal oscillator fails can not be started

- Test pulse accuracy and jitter

- Pull-down resistor for MISO line on LPC812 NRF24L01 variant

- Add 100uF tantal (2x 47uF?) to 3.3V rail to prevent brown-outs

- Re-initialize RF when failsafe triggers.
  With very weak batteries it happens that a brown-out causes the RF module
  to loose its configuration while the microcontroller still happily runs.
  The MCU sees no signal, hence triggers failsafe, which never recovers unless
  the receiver is powered off and on again.
  If we re-initialize the whole RF system whenever failsafe triggers (and
  regularly during failsafe?) then the system can recover.
