# STM32F103 and NRF24L01+ based headless transmitter

This project implements a 2.4 GHz RC transmitter using the NRF24L01+ wireless module and the STM32F103C8T6 module. It runs of a 1S Li-Ion battery.

The transmitter is designed to be used in old RC transmitter hardware, or to turn a cheap RC simulator transmitter into a fully operational RC transmitter. As such it is designed for headless operation. Setup is carried out via a wirelessly connected programming box.
